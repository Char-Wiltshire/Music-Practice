Music Practice Tracker:

An application that helps the user keep track on how may hours they are taking when practicing an instrument.
This currently supports 6 instruments in the drop-down menu.
Users can also input freely how many hours they took in the text field.
Finally, this app keeps track of the data and generates a weekly graph based on the inputs of the user.

This is a local application integrating both ReactJS (frontend) and Django (backend)
